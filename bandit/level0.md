# Level 0

## We need to SSH

this level requires us to SSH to connect to a host

The format to SSH into a host

``` ssh username@host -pPORTNUMBER ```

If something apart from the default port (22) is being used then we use -p to define the port number 

Here it becomes:

``` ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ```
